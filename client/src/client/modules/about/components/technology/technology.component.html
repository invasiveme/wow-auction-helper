        The web client
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      The client is created using the latest version of Angular.
    </p>
    <p>
    The application uses Angular Material combined with Bootstrap 4 for it's styling.
    Some custom modifications has been made also. For icons I've used Font Awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
      The charts in the app is created with <a href="https://www.chartjs.org" target="_blank">Charts.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The client is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket.

        Server side

    <p>
      The backend comes in two parts. One that handles anything user related, and one that handles auction data, items etc.
    </p>

    <h6>User data backend</h6>
    <p>
      <strong>AWS Cognito:</strong>
      Handles user login and sessions. The front-end uses AWS amplify to communicate with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AWS AppSync:</strong>
      Handles user settings, and syncronizes them between devices and browsers.
    </p>

    <h6>Game data backend</h6>
    <p>
      The current backend is written with NodeJS with TypeScript, and is created as AWS Lambdas.
      This is the third iteration of the back-end. Originally it was in PHP, then NodeJS with ExpressJS, and now it's moved to AWS Lambda.
    </p>

    <h6>Storage</h6>
    <p>
      <strong>DynamoDB(NoSQL):</strong>
      Is used for keeping track of when auction houses last were updated, and similar data.
      I am using it for this, as it is serverless, fast, cheap, and will not cause issues with too many concurrent connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>MariaDB(RDS):</strong>
      The item price history is stored in a RDS database, as that is what makes sense for this kind of data.
      It is only the backend that adds data to this database, and the insertion of new price data is queued in order to not loose price history.

      The price history is stored per month for 6 day, and per hour for 14 days.

      The RDS database also stores, recipes, items etc. But the user will never get the data directly from here, but instead via AWS S3 as that is faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AWS Simple Storage Solution (S3):</strong>
      Is used to store any static data. Items, professions, the client, auction data, tsm data etc. AWS S3, is really fast and also scales really well.
      Raw auction data is stored for 14 days. The app also uses to store queued item price history queries, and once a query is processed it's deleted from S3.
